Problem-Statement:- 

You are given a sequence a of n integers. Print the sum of the 
weight of all subsegments of a.

The weight of a sequence is number of unordered pairs of indexes (i,j) (here i<j) with
same value (ai=aj)

Constraints:-

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
a1,a2,…,an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9)

Output :-

The sum of the weight of all subsegments of a
