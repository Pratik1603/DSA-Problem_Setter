Problem Statement -

The problem requires rearranging a given binary string 𝑠.
s representing the current schedule, to maximize the number of occurrences of 
another binary string 𝑡
t as a contiguous substring within 𝑠 . The lengths of s and t can differ, and the
rearrangement must preserve the number of '1's (contest days) and '0's (days off) in 𝑠
only changing their order.

Constraints: -
string s (1⩽|s|⩽500000)
string t (1⩽|t|⩽500000)

Output: -

Printed schedule should consist of characters '0' and '1' only and the number of zeros should be equal to the number of zeros in s
and the number of ones should be equal to the number of ones in s.

input -
101101
110

output-
110110
